      				<h2>Investing for a better tomorrow</h2>
      				<p>The majority of students do not have a lot of spare cash so it can be challenging for them to choose between investing in their own future or the causes that they believe in to build a better future for others.</p>  
      				<div style="height:180px;"> </div>
      				<p>Our mission is to encourage students to invest in companies that make donations to charities on their behalf.</p>

    			<div class="box">
      				<h2>Change starts with you</h2>
      				<p>Large companies have the capital needed to make sizeable donations but many of these acts go unnoticed. That's why we created a platform that connects students to companies that make donations to the charities that they are interested in. Students will be able to support charities they believe in by investing in companies that are driven to make donations to such causes.</p>
      				<div style="height:180px;"> </div>
      				<p>Students will be able to not only learn more about financial planning but also help support various philanthropic services.</p>
